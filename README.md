# trying-to-clone-Trello-with-Solidity-React

I don't know how to deploy this crap yet. lolz. 

The cost to use this piece of code is too high. <br />
~36 bucks to get it deployed on ganache <br />
~30$ for every 1 jobs + 2 checklists + 3 tasks/checklists which is kinda like Iphone X and Iphone R. Expensive and Ridiculous. <br />
Doesn't cost much to share jobs though (~1-2 cents or maybe less). <br />
(I might be wrong because I'm using ganache to test it out) <br />
No stabbing behind yo back action allowed so can apply this idea into a private blockchain system. <br />

Ganache is like the pleb version of insomnia. <br />
A disgusting coder who take advantage of reactstrap like I am is a lazy coder. However, the readablity increases greatly so other people can help out easily if I stuck at some point.  <br />
