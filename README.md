# trying-to-clone-Trello-with-Solidity-React

I don't know how to deploy this crap yet. lolz. 

The cost to use this piece of code is too high. 
~36 bucks to get it deployed on ganache 
~3-4$ for every 1 jobs + 2 checklists + 3 tasks/checklists which is kinda like Iphone X and Iphone R. Expensive and Ridiculous.
Doesn't cost much to share jobs though.
No stabbing behind yo back action allowed so can apply this idea into a private blockchain system.

Ganache is like the pleb version of insomnia.
A disgusting coder who take advantage of reactstrap like I am is a lazy coder. However, the readablity increases greatly so other people can help out easily if I stuck at some point.
