# trying-to-clone-Trello-with-Solidity-React

I don't know how to deploy this crap yet. lolz. 

The cost to use this piece of code is too high. 
~36 bucks to get it deployed on ganache 
~30$ for every 1 jobs + 2 checklists + 3 tasks/checklists which is kinda like Iphone X and Iphone R. Expensive and Ridiculous.
Doesn't cost much to share jobs though.
(I might be wrong because I'm using ganache to test it out)
No stabbing behind yo back action allowed so can apply this idea into a private blockchain system.

Ganache is like the pleb version of insomnia.
A disgusting coder who take advantage of reactstrap like I am is a lazy coder. However, the readablity increases greatly so other people can help out easily if I stuck at some point.
